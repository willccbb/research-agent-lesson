      "The NBA Playoffs are reaching a dramatic conclusion as the Oklahoma City Thunder have secured their place in the NBA Finals by defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves 4-1 in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder's success was built on their depth, defense, and the continued star performances of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams, and rookie standout Chet Holmgren. Oklahoma City closed out the series with a dominant performance, showcasing their readiness to contend for their first championship since relocating from Seattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Eastern Conference Finals are turning into a showcase for Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, who delivered a historic Game 4 triple-double—posting at least 30 points, 15 assists, and 10 rebounds with no turnovers, a feat never before accomplished in NBA playoff history. His efforts, alongside key moments from teammate Aaron Nesmith, have pushed the Pacers to a commanding 3-1 series lead over the New York Knicks, putting Indiana on the brink of its first NBA Finals appearance in decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Off the court, there have been significant developments as well. Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook announced he underwent surgery to repair two breaks in his right hand, an injury sustained during the season. The Nuggets also introduced new head coach David Adelman, who discussed plans for player conditioning and strategic adjustments heading into the offseason.
