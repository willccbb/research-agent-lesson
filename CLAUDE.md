# Report Generation Guidelines

## Overview
When generating research reports, follow these specific formatting and content guidelines to ensure consistent, high-quality output.

## Content Requirements

### 1. Importance-Based Ranking
- **Rank all events, conferences, and findings by importance/relevance**
- Use a tier system: "Must-Attend," "Highly Recommended," "Notable," and "Optional"
- Consider factors: audience size, industry impact, speaker quality, networking potential
- Place the most important events first in each section

### 2. Spam and Low-Quality Content Filtering
- **Strongly filter out spammy or low-quality events**
- Exclude:
  - Generic "business networking" events without tech focus
  - Obvious sales/marketing webinars disguised as conferences
  - Events with poor track records or suspicious organizers
  - Duplicate or near-duplicate events
  - Events with vague descriptions or unclear value propositions
- Prioritize established conferences, academic events, and industry-recognized gatherings

### 3. Limerick Summaries
- **Include a limerick summary for each major event or section**
- Place limericks after the main description
- Use proper limerick structure (AABBA rhyme scheme)
- Keep content informative yet entertaining
- Example format:
  ```
  *A tech week in NYC so grand,*
  *Where startups and VCs all band,*
  *With pitches galore,*
  *And networking more,*
  *Makes June the best time in the land.*
  ```

### 4. Cost and Discount Information
- **Always include pricing when available**
- Search for and note:
  - Early bird discounts and deadlines
  - Student discounts
  - Group rates
  - Free tier access or community tickets
  - Promo codes (when publicly available)
- Format: "**Cost:** $X (Early bird: $Y until [date])"
- If pricing unavailable, note "Pricing TBA" or "Contact for pricing"

### 5. Celebrity and Notable Speaker Flagging
- **Flag potential celebrity sightings and high-profile speakers**
- Include a "< Notable Speakers" section for each major event
- Highlight:
  - Tech industry celebrities (Musk, Gates, Bezos, etc.)
  - Famous founders and CEOs
  - Academic luminaries
  - Government officials
  - Popular tech influencers and thought leaders
- Use clear formatting: "< **Celebrity Alert:** [Name] - [Title/Company]"
